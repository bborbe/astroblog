     ☐ Create GitHub Actions workflow

⏺ Now I need to help you create the GitHub repository. You'll need to do this part manually since I can't create
  repositories on your GitHub account. Here are the steps:

  Create GitHub Repository

  1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository:
  - Visit https://github.com/new
  - Repository name: astroblog (or your preferred name)
  - Make it public (required for GitHub Pages)
  - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

  2. After creating the repository, you'll get a remote URL. Run these commands:

⏺ Bash(git add .)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git commit -m "Initial commit with PRD and project setup")
  ⎿  [master (root-commit) be0f706] Initial commit with PRD and project setup
      3 files changed, 293 insertions(+)
      create mode 100644 .gitignore
     … +2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ 3. Once you create the GitHub repository, add the remote and push:

  # Replace 'yourusername' with your GitHub username
  git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/astroblog.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Initialize Git repository
     ☒ Create initial project structure
     ☒ Set up GitHub repository
     ☐ Configure GitHub Pages deployment
     ☐ Create GitHub Actions workflow

⏺ Now let me create the GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment:

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p .github/workflows)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Write(.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
  ⎿  Wrote 39 lines to .github/workflows/deploy.yml
     name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
     on:
       # Trigger the workflow every time you push to the `main` branch
       push:
         branches: [ main ]
       # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab on GitHub
       workflow_dispatch:
     # Allow this job to clone the repo and create a page deployment
     … +29 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Initialize Git repository
     ☒ Create initial project structure
     ☒ Set up GitHub repository
     ☒ Configure GitHub Pages deployment
     ☒ Create GitHub Actions workflow

⏺ Perfect! I've set up the Git project and GitHub integration. Here's what's been completed:

  ✅ Completed Setup

  1. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
  2. Project files created: README.md with documentation
  3. GitHub Actions workflow configured for automatic deployment
  4. Initial commit made and ready to push

  🔧 Next Steps for You

  After creating your GitHub repository:

  1. Enable GitHub Pages:
    - Go to your repository → Settings → Pages
    - Source: "GitHub Actions"
    - The workflow will automatically deploy when you push
  2. Push your code:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/astroblog.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  3. Your blog will be available at:
    - https://yourusername.github.io/astroblog (if repository name is "astroblog")
    - https://yourusername.github.io (if repository name is "yourusername.github.io")

  The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy your Astro blog whenever you push changes to
  the main branch. You're now ready to start building the actual Astro blog application!

> I have created a GitHub repository under the following URL: https://github.com/bborbe/astroblog

⏺ Perfect! Now let's connect your local repository to the GitHub repository and push the initial setup.

⏺ Bash(git remote add origin https://github.com/bborbe/astroblog.git)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git branch -M main)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Let's use SSH Instead of HTTPS.

⏺ Bash(git remote remove origin)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git remote add origin git@github.com:bborbe/astroblog.git)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git branch -M main)

⏺ Perfect! I've generated the complete task list with detailed sub-tasks. The implementation is broken down into
  5 main phases with 28 specific sub-tasks that will guide you through building the entire Astro blog.

  Summary of the Task List:

  1.0 Initialize Astro Project - Sets up the framework and configuration
  2.0 Content Management - Creates the Markdown-based blog post system3.0 Homepage - Builds the chronological
  post listing
  4.0 Individual Post Pages - Implements dynamic routing for blog posts
  5.0 Responsive Design - Adds styling and optimization

  The task list includes all relevant files you'll need to create, from configuration files to components and
  layouts. Each sub-task is specific and actionable for a junior developer to follow.

  You're now ready to start implementing the blog! Would you like me to help you begin with the first task
  (initializing the Astro project)?

     # Product Requirements Document: Astro Technical Blog
     ## Introduction/Overview
     This PRD defines the requirements for building a minimal, static technical blog using Astro.js that will be
     hosted on GitHub Pages. The blog will focus on technical and programming content, with support for embedded
     YouTube videos within Markdown blog posts. The primary goal is to create a simple, fast-loading blog platform
      that allows easy content creation through Markdown files while providing a clean reading experience.
     ## Goals
     1. Create a minimal, performant static blog using Astro.js
     2. Enable seamless YouTube video embedding within blog posts

     … +92 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I've created a comprehensive PRD for your Astro technical blog based on your selections. The document
  has been saved as /tasks/prd-astro-blog.md.

  The PRD includes:
  - Minimal scope aligned with your preferences (chronological posts, simple YouTube embeds, basic functionality)
  - Technical focus for programming content
  - GitHub Pages deployment instructions
  - Clear functional requirements that a junior developer can implement
  - Defined non-goals to keep the project focused and manageable

  The PRD is ready to guide development of your static blog with Astro.js, focusing on simplicity, performance,
  and ease of content creation through Markdown files.

> Ok, now let's set up the Git project and the GitHub integration.

     ☐ Create GitHub Actions workflow

⏺ Now I need to help you create the GitHub repository. You'll need to do this part manually since I can't create
  repositories on your GitHub account. Here are the steps:

  Create GitHub Repository

  1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository:
  - Visit https://github.com/new
  - Repository name: astroblog (or your preferred name)
  - Make it public (required for GitHub Pages)
  - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

  2. After creating the repository, you'll get a remote URL. Run these commands:

⏺ Bash(git add .)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git commit -m "Initial commit with PRD and project setup")
  ⎿  [master (root-commit) be0f706] Initial commit with PRD and project setup
      3 files changed, 293 insertions(+)
      create mode 100644 .gitignore
     … +2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ 3. Once you create the GitHub repository, add the remote and push:

  # Replace 'yourusername' with your GitHub username
  git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/astroblog.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Initialize Git repository
     ☒ Create initial project structure
     ☒ Set up GitHub repository
     ☐ Configure GitHub Pages deployment
     ☐ Create GitHub Actions workflow

⏺ Now let me create the GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment:

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p .github/workflows)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Write(.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
  ⎿  Wrote 39 lines to .github/workflows/deploy.yml
     name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
     on:
       # Trigger the workflow every time you push to the `main` branch
       push:
         branches: [ main ]
       # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab on GitHub
       workflow_dispatch:
     # Allow this job to clone the repo and create a page deployment
     … +29 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Initialize Git repository
     ☒ Create initial project structure
     ☒ Set up GitHub repository
     ☒ Configure GitHub Pages deployment
     ☒ Create GitHub Actions workflow

⏺ Perfect! I've set up the Git project and GitHub integration. Here's what's been completed:

  ✅ Completed Setup

  1. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
  2. Project files created: README.md with documentation
  3. GitHub Actions workflow configured for automatic deployment
  4. Initial commit made and ready to push

  🔧 Next Steps for You

  After creating your GitHub repository:

  1. Enable GitHub Pages:
    - Go to your repository → Settings → Pages
    - Source: "GitHub Actions"
    - The workflow will automatically deploy when you push
  2. Push your code:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/astroblog.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  3. Your blog will be available at:
    - https://yourusername.github.io/astroblog (if repository name is "astroblog")
    - https://yourusername.github.io (if repository name is "yourusername.github.io")

  The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy your Astro blog whenever you push changes to
  the main branch. You're now ready to start building the actual Astro blog application!

> I have created a GitHub repository under the following URL: https://github.com/bborbe/astroblog

⏺ Perfect! Now let's connect your local repository to the GitHub repository and push the initial setup.

⏺ Bash(git remote add origin https://github.com/bborbe/astroblog.git)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git branch -M main)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Let's use SSH Instead of HTTPS.

⏺ Bash(git remote remove origin)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git remote add origin git@github.com:bborbe/astroblog.git)
  ⎿  (No content)

     ☐ Create GitHub Actions workflow

⏺ Now I need to help you create the GitHub repository. You'll need to do this part manually since I can't create
  repositories on your GitHub account. Here are the steps:

  Create GitHub Repository

  1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository:
  - Visit https://github.com/new
  - Repository name: astroblog (or your preferred name)
  - Make it public (required for GitHub Pages)
  - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

  2. After creating the repository, you'll get a remote URL. Run these commands:

⏺ Bash(git add .)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git commit -m "Initial commit with PRD and project setup")
  ⎿  [master (root-commit) be0f706] Initial commit with PRD and project setup
      3 files changed, 293 insertions(+)
      create mode 100644 .gitignore
     … +2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ 3. Once you create the GitHub repository, add the remote and push:

  # Replace 'yourusername' with your GitHub username
  git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/astroblog.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Initialize Git repository
     ☒ Create initial project structure
     ☒ Set up GitHub repository
     ☐ Configure GitHub Pages deployment
     ☐ Create GitHub Actions workflow

⏺ Now let me create the GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment:

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p .github/workflows)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Write(.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
  ⎿  Wrote 39 lines to .github/workflows/deploy.yml
     name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
     on:
       # Trigger the workflow every time you push to the `main` branch
       push:
         branches: [ main ]
       # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab on GitHub
       workflow_dispatch:
     # Allow this job to clone the repo and create a page deployment
     … +29 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Initialize Git repository
     ☒ Create initial project structure
     ☒ Set up GitHub repository
     ☒ Configure GitHub Pages deployment
     ☒ Create GitHub Actions workflow

⏺ Perfect! I've set up the Git project and GitHub integration. Here's what's been completed:

  ✅ Completed Setup

  1. Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
  2. Project files created: README.md with documentation
  3. GitHub Actions workflow configured for automatic deployment
  4. Initial commit made and ready to push

  🔧 Next Steps for You

  After creating your GitHub repository:

  1. Enable GitHub Pages:
    - Go to your repository → Settings → Pages
    - Source: "GitHub Actions"
    - The workflow will automatically deploy when you push
  2. Push your code:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/astroblog.git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  3. Your blog will be available at:
    - https://yourusername.github.io/astroblog (if repository name is "astroblog")
    - https://yourusername.github.io (if repository name is "yourusername.github.io")

  The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy your Astro blog whenever you push changes to
  the main branch. You're now ready to start building the actual Astro blog application!

> I have created a GitHub repository under the following URL: https://github.com/bborbe/astroblog

⏺ Perfect! Now let's connect your local repository to the GitHub repository and push the initial setup.

⏺ Bash(git remote add origin https://github.com/bborbe/astroblog.git)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git branch -M main)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Let's use SSH Instead of HTTPS.

⏺ Bash(git remote remove origin)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git remote add origin git@github.com:bborbe/astroblog.git)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Bash(git branch -M main)

⏺ Perfect! I've generated the complete task list with detailed sub-tasks. The implementation is broken down into
  5 main phases with 28 specific sub-tasks that will guide you through building the entire Astro blog.

  Summary of the Task List:

  1.0 Initialize Astro Project - Sets up the framework and configuration
  2.0 Content Management - Creates the Markdown-based blog post system3.0 Homepage - Builds the chronological
  post listing
  4.0 Individual Post Pages - Implements dynamic routing for blog posts
  5.0 Responsive Design - Adds styling and optimization

  The task list includes all relevant files you'll need to create, from configuration files to components and
  layouts. Each sub-task is specific and actionable for a junior developer to follow.

  You're now ready to start implementing the blog! Would you like me to help you begin with the first task
  (initializing the Astro project)?

> /process-task-list is running…

⏺ I'll help you implement the Astro blog following the task list. Let me start with the first sub-task and follow
   the completion protocol.

> Okay, deployment sounds good.

⏺ Perfect! Let's deploy the blog to GitHub Pages. The deployment process should be automatic thanks to the GitHub
   Actions workflow we set up earlier.

⏺ Bash(git push origin main)
  ⎿  To github.com:bborbe/astroblog.git
        be0f706..caa9dc0  main -> main

⏺ Great! The code has been pushed to GitHub. Now let's check if GitHub Pages is properly configured:

⏺ Bash(gh repo view bborbe/astroblog --web)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me check the Actions status:

⏺ Bash(gh run list --repo bborbe/astroblog)

⏺ The deployment failed. Let me check what went wrong:

⏺ Bash(gh run view 16496454759 --repo bborbe/astroblog)

⏺ The deployment failed due to a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact. Let me fix the GitHub Actions
  workflow:

⏺ Read(.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
  ⎿  Read 39 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The issue is that we need to update the deploy action version. Let me fix the workflow:

⏺ Update(.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
  ⎿  Updated .github/workflows/deploy.yml with 1 addition and 1 removal
       36        steps:
       37          - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

       40 +          uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
       41   \ No newline at end of file

⏺ Also, let me update the Astro action to the latest version:

⏺ Update(.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
  ⎿  Updated .github/workflows/deploy.yml with 1 addition and 1 removal
       21            uses: actions/checkout@v4

       24 -          uses: withastro/action@v1
       24 +          uses: withastro/action@v2
       25            with:
       26              path: . # The root location of your Astro project inside the repository. (optional)
       27              node-version: 18 # The specific version of Node that should be used to build your site.
            Defaults to 18. (optional)

  The dark theme uses GitHub's color palette for a professional, developer-friendly appearance that's easy on the
   eyes. All interactive elements maintain proper contrast and accessibility while looking sleek in dark mode!

> The PLOX looks nice, but I am missing a nice header image. Can you generate one with AI and use it?

⏺ I can't generate AI images directly, but I can help you add a header image to your blog once you have one! Here
   are a few options for getting a nice header image:

  🎨 Options for Header Images:

  1. Free Stock Images:

  - Unsplash: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/coding
  - Pexels: https://pexels.com/search/programming/
  - Pixabay: https://pixabay.com/images/search/technology/

  2. AI Image Generators:

  - DALL-E 2/3: https://openai.com/dall-e-2
  - Midjourney: https://midjourney.com
  - Stable Diffusion: https://stablediffusionweb.com

  3. Simple Gradient/Pattern:

  I could create a CSS gradient header as a placeholder while you find an image.

  🛠️ Once You Have an Image:

  1. Save it as /public/hero-image.jpg (or similar)
  2. I'll update the homepage to include it as a header
  3. Add responsive styling to make it look great

  Would you like me to:
  - A) Create a temporary CSS gradient header while you find an image?
  - B) Set up the image structure so you can easily add one later?
  - C) Wait until you have a specific image to add?

  What would work best for you?

> [Image #1] Here is a file you can use.

⏺ Perfect! That's a beautiful space-themed header image that matches your blog name "ASTROBLOG" perfectly! Let me
   add it to your blog.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Add header image to blog

⏺ First, let me save the image to the public directory:

⏺ Write(public/hero-image.jpg)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to public/hero-image.jpg
     I'll need to save the actual image file. Since I can't directly save the image from your message, let me set
     up the structure and you can save the image as /public/hero-image.jpg

⏺ Actually, let me first check what's in the public directory and then show you how to save the image:

⏺ List(public)
  ⎿  Listed 5 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me remove that placeholder file and show you how to properly save the image:

⏺ Bash(rm /Users/bborbe/Documents/workspaces/astroblog/public/hero-image.jpg)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ To add the image:
  1. Save the image you provided as /Users/bborbe/Documents/workspaces/astroblog/public/hero-image.jpg
  2. Then I'll update the homepage to use it

  For now, let me update the homepage to include the header image structure:

⏺ Read(src/pages/index.astro)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Update(src/pages/index.astro)
  ⎿  Updated src/pages/index.astro with 3 additions
       109      </head>
       110      <body>
       111        <header>
       112 +        <div class="hero-image">
       113 +          <img src="/astroblog/hero-image.jpg" alt="AstroBlog - Space-themed illustration with
     laptop,
           +  rocket, and coding elements" />
       114 +        </div>
       115          <h1>Technical Blog</h1>
       116          <p class="subtitle">Programming tutorials, web development tips, and tech insights</p>
       117        </header>

⏺ Now let me add the CSS styling for the hero image:

⏺ Update(src/pages/index.astro)
  ⎿  Updated src/pages/index.astro with 11 additions
       36            padding-bottom: 2rem;
       37          }
       38
       39 +        .hero-image {
       40 +          margin-bottom: 2rem;
       41 +        }
       42 +
       43 +        .hero-image img {
       44 +          max-width: 100%;
       45 +          height: auto;
       46 +          border-radius: 12px;
       47 +          box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
       48 +        }
       49 +
       50          h1 {
       51            color: #f0f6fc;
       52            font-size: 2.5rem;

⏺ Let me also update the mobile responsive styling for the hero image:

⏺ Update(src/pages/index.astro)
  ⎿  Updated src/pages/index.astro with 8 additions
       115            .post-item {
       116              padding: 1rem;
       117            }
       118 +
       119 +          .hero-image {
       120 +            margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
       121 +          }
       122 +
       123 +          .hero-image img {
       124 +            border-radius: 8px;
       125 +          }
       126          }
       127        </style>
       128      </head>

⏺ Now I need you to save the image. Please save the image you provided as
  /Users/bborbe/Documents/workspaces/astroblog/public/hero-image.jpg so it can be used by the blog.

  After you save the image, let me test the build and deploy:
