# Task List: Astro Technical Blog Implementation

Based on the PRD analysis, here are the tasks needed to implement the Astro technical blog:

## Relevant Files

- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts for Astro blog
- `astro.config.mjs` - Astro configuration with content collections and optimizations
- `src/content/config.ts` - Content collection schema definitions for blog posts
- `src/content/posts/` - Directory containing Markdown blog post files
- `src/pages/index.astro` - Homepage displaying chronological list of blog posts
- `src/pages/posts/[...slug].astro` - Dynamic route for individual blog post pages
- `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - Base HTML layout with meta tags and responsive design
- `src/layouts/PostLayout.astro` - Layout specifically for blog post pages
- `src/components/PostCard.astro` - Component for displaying post previews on homepage
- `src/components/YouTubeEmbed.astro` - Component for responsive YouTube video embeds
- `src/styles/global.css` - Global styles for typography, responsive design, and layout
- `public/favicon.ico` - Site favicon and other static assets

### Notes

- Astro uses file-based routing where files in `src/pages/` become routes
- Content collections in `src/content/` provide type-safe Markdown processing
- Components ending in `.astro` are Astro's component format
- Static assets go in the `public/` directory
- Run `npm run dev` to start development server, `npm run build` to build for production
